### Tech stack

### What can it do?

The budget planner allows you to manage your expenses in a simple user interface. The application keeps track of payment
dates, which it uses to calculate the required account balances, to avoid overdrawing.

### Try it out ðŸš€

I'm hosting the app [here on Vercel](https://svelte-budget-planner.vercel.app/). You can sign in using your GitHub
account or as a demo user.

### Installation

If you want to run it yourself you can follow these instructions.

I use the Vercel CLI to link the application with my project in Vercel ([Read more](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)).

```bash
npx vercel link
```

After linking the project, create an `.env` file by running:

```bash
npx vercel env pull .env
```

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are need.

#### Auth.js

The app is only set up to work with GitHub so these variables are required.

```

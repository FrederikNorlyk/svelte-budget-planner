## Svelte budget planner
Simple budget planning application, built using SvelteKit.

### Technologies
- SvelteKit
- Auth.js (OAuth 2.0)
- TypeScript
- Skeleton UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest (Unit tests)

### What can it do?
ðŸ›‘ This project is still very much a work in progress.

The budget planner allows you to manage your expenses in a simple user interface. The application keeps track of payment dates, which it uses to calculate the required account balances, to avoid overdrawing.

### Try it out
I'm hosting the app [here on Vercel](https://svelte-budget-planner.vercel.app/). You can sign in using your GitHub account or as a demo user.

### Installation
